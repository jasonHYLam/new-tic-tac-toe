## Goals
The ultimate purpose of this project was to learn how to use factory functions and modules in Javascript. This was done by applying such implementnation in a Tic Tac Toe web game.

## What I've learned

Many new concepts were learned, including:

- get/set methods
- uncoupled code
- instantly invoked function expressions (IIFE)
- pass by reference vs pass by value
- closures
- separation of concerns (eg. DOM display, game state, etc.)
- event delegation (for event handler)
- interfaces (to allow display controller to communicate with game state)

## Reflection
This was quite an exciting project, as I got a first taste of how to structure code.
